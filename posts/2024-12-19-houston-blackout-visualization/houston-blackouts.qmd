# Identifying the impacts of extreme weather

During February of 2021, Texas suffered a major power crisis resulting from three unusually severe winter storms. Here, we visualize the impacts of extreme weather on Houston's power grid by estimating the number of homes in the Houston metropolitan area that lost power and investigating whether not these impacts were disproportionately felt.etu

## Reflection

I found that median household income was slightly higher in the census tracts that lost power vs. those that did not lose power. Census tracts on the outskirts of the Houston area generally experienced less power loss, but most of the majority of tracts were still affected. According to [Busby et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629621001997), all socio-economic groups were affected, but the effects of the storm were harder on low-income families, who live in older, poorly insulated homes and have limited access to resources for repairs and physical health after the storm.
