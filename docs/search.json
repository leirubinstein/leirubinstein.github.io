This data was retrieved from the Microsoft Planetary Computer data catalogue and pre-processed to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution.\nCalifornia’s Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) maintains a comprehensive database of historical fire perimeters throughout the state, covering both public and private lands.

    "text": "Biography\nI earned my Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Environmental Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2021. Inspired by Santa Barbara’s legacy of environmental activism, I have dedicated myself to running local and federal campaigns with social justice and conservation-driven values for the past seven years. Following my undergraduate degree, I worked at an environmental law firm, specializing in litigation and regulatory disputes relating to remediation of Superfund sites. My professional experience includes roles in political organizing, legislation, and environmental law, where I honed skills in data management, community engagement, and environmental policy analysis.\nCurrently pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School, I aspire to work in government or to conduct policy relevant research after graduation. I aim to leverage data science techniques to develop solutions for resource management and climate change mitigation, promoting sustainable practices and enhancing climate resilience locally and globally.\nIn my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, gaming, and exploring nature and the night sky through my camera lens."

    "text": "Santa Barbara’s coastal waters host some of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth, Macrocystis pyrifera, or giant kelp forests. Kelp are a keystone species, and provide food, shelter and protection for all kinds of marine life, including commercially valuable fisheries. According to NOAA, factors influencing kelp forest growth include nutrients, light levels, temperatures, and ocean currents. Research by Smith et. al newly found that kelp use urea, in addition to ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen as nutrients for growth.\nIn this analysis, I would like to examine the relationship between ocean chemistry and kelp forest biomass, and develop a model for nutrient growth factors on biomass.\nThis exercise was produced as a part of the UCSB MEDS Program for EDS 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science, taught by Dr. Max Czapanskiy.\n\n\n\n1. SBC LTER: Reef: Annual time series of biomass for kelp forest species, ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data are annual estimates of biomass of approximately 225 taxa of reef algae, invertebrates and fish in permanent transects at 11 kelp forest sites in the Santa Barbara Channel (2-8 transects per site). Abundance is measured annually (as percent cover or density, by size) and converted to biomass (i.e., wet mass, dry mass, decalcified dry mass, ash free dry mass) using published taxon-specific algorithms. Data collection began in summer 2000 and continues annually in summer to provide information on community structure, population dynamics and species change.\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER Reef Sites\n\n\n2. SBC LTER: Ocean: Ocean Currents and Biogeochemistry: Nearshore water profiles (monthly CTD and chemistry), ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data contain water chemistry measurements taken monthly at these reefs in the nearshore areas of the Santa Barbra Channel, CA, USA: Arroyo Quemado, Bullito, Naples, Arroyo Burro, Mohawk and Carpinteria. Measurements include standard CTD parameters, nutrients, pigments, particulate CN, total dissolved N and P, stable isotopes of C and N (not all parameters are measured at all stations). Sampling began in November 2000. Starting in February 2003, a SBE19-Plus with a rosette sampler was used. Some stations are sampled only occasionally.\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER Ocean Bottle Sites\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(readtext)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\nset.seed(42)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Read in kelp and ocean chemistry data\nspecies &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\n  \"posts/2024-12-12-ocean-chem-kelp/data/Annual_All_Species_Biomass_at_transect_20240823.csv\"), na = \"-99999\") %&gt;%\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\nocean_chem &lt;- read.table(here::here(\"posts/2024-12-12-ocean-chem-kelp/data/LTER_monthly_bottledata_20240821.txt\"), \n  header = TRUE, sep = \";\", na = c(\"BDL\", \"99999\")) %&gt;% # `BDL` = below detection level\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n# Filter to Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera)\nkelp &lt;- species %&gt;%\n  filter(scientific_name == \"Macrocystis pyrifera\")\n\n\nThe variables I plan to use for ocean chemistry are (in units of micromoles per liter):\n\nno2_no3_umol_l = concentration of the sum of nitrate and nitrite\npon_umol_l = concentration of particulate organic nitrogen\ntdn_umol_l= concentration of dissolved nitrogen\nammonia_umol_l= concentration of ammonium\nurea_umol_l= concentration of urea\n\nThe variables I plan to use for kelp biomass are:\n\nwm_gm2 = areal wet mass of individuals or colony in grams per square meter\ndensity = density taxon per squared meter in number per square meter\n\nNote: there are other measures of biomass in ocean_chem.

Biomass Model model_wm\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp biomass (p = 0.00749). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp wet mass increases by 147.54 grams/square meter when the reference site is BULL. Consistent with the “Monthly Average Giant Kelp Biomass by Site” plot, the MOHK site has significantly higher biomass than the other sites (coef = 3187.67, p = 1.46e-5). The model explains about 32.4% of the variation in biomass (not great).\n2. Log Biomass Model model_wm_log\nThere is a marginally significant positive relationship between PON and log-transformed kelp biomass (p = 0.080). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, log kelp wet mass increases by 0.068 units when the reference site is BULL. The ABUR site shows significantly lower biomass (coef = -1.389, p = 0.006) while MOHK shows significantly higher biomass (coef = 1.498, p = 0.003) compared to other sites. The model explains about 26.1% of the variation in log biomass (poor fit).\n3. Biomass Density Model model_wm_density\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp density (p = 0.002). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp density increases by 0.317 individuals per square meter when the reference site is BULL. Similar to the biomass models, the MOHK site shows significantly higher density than other sites (coef = 7.853, p &lt; 0.001). This model has the best fit of the three, explaining about 43.3% of the variation in density, but still is not great.\n\n\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH0: Particulate organic nitrogen has no effect on kelp biomass\nHA: Particulate organic nitrogen has an effect on kelp biomass\n\n\n\nCode\n# Get observed coefficient for pon_umol_l\nobserved_coef &lt;- coef(summary(model_wm))[\"pon_umol_l\", \"t value\"]\n\n# Create randomizations\nnull_dist &lt;- replicate(1000, {\n  rand_joined_data &lt;- joined_data %&gt;% \n    ungroup() %&gt;% \n    mutate(pon_umol_l = sample(pon_umol_l))\n  \n  rand_model &lt;- lm(wm_gm2 ~ pon_umol_l + site, data = rand_joined_data)\n  coef(summary(rand_model))[\"pon_umol_l\", \"t value\"]\n})\n\n# Calculate p-value (two-sided test)\np_value &lt;- mean(abs(null_dist) &gt;= abs(observed_coef))\n\n# Plot the null distribution\nnull_dist_df &lt;- data.frame(t_stat = null_dist)\nggplot(null_dist_df, aes(x = t_stat)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, \n                 fill = \"#6d8c23\", \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = observed_coef, color = \"orchid\", linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Null Distribution of PON Coefficient t-statistics\",\n       x = \"t-statistic\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Randomization test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nRandomization test p-value: 0.003 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Observed t-statistic:\", observed_coef, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved t-statistic: 2.734869 \n\n\nThis randomization test shuffled the data n = 1000 times to determine what the point estimate (t-statistic) would be if it occurred by chance. 0nly 0.3% of the time would a value of t = 2.37 be produced as chance. At a threshold of alpha = 0.05, we can reject our null hypothesis and state that PON has a positive effect on kelp wet mass.\nThe observed t-statistic is 2.73, which means that the estimated coefficient is 2.73 standard errors away from zero. In the figure, the null distribution shows us what we would expect if there was no relationship between PON and biomass (measured by density). The purple line falls outside of the majority of the distribution, which tells us that there is a strong relationship between PON and density.\n\n\n\nDue to incomplete data, I could not perform my intended analysis. The ocean chemistry and kelp data were inconsistently collected across sites and months, leaving very few usable data points after cleaning.\nThe model likely suffers from omitted variable bias. While prior research has established that temperature, currents, and light levels affect kelp growth, my model only included PON and site as variables, excluding other nutrients and physical variables.\nAutocorrelation may have affected the results because samples were taken at monthly intervals, and ecological conditions typically carry over from one month to the next. This violation of independence could lead to underestimated standard errors and overstated significance in the statistical results. However, techniques to reduce autocorrelation, such as a temporal lag model, were not feasible given the substantial missing data, which included gaps of several months in the joined dataset.\nOverall, the results of my models should not be considered reliable due to the significant data gaps. I had overestimated the completeness of the LTER data for this research question.\nFor future research, I would like to analyze Thomas Fire effects on kelp growth using a more complete ocean chemistry dataset. Researchers at UCSB discovered that wildfire ash from the 2017 Thomas Fire resulted in significant additions of dissolved nutrients, including inorganic and organic nitrogen, silicic acid, metals, and organic carbon. Furthermore, this ash leachate resulted in an increase of relative abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton. Since the impacts of wildfire products on Macrocystis pyrifera remain understudied, this could be a valuable area for investigation. Additional factors to consider would include kelp recruitment rates using a temporal lag model and dissolved metal concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nCitation\nLink\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER: Ocean: Ocean Currents and Biogeochemistry: Nearshore water profiles (monthly CTD and chemistry), ongoing since 2000\nWashburn, L., M.

    "text": "Santa Barbara’s coastal waters host some of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth, Macrocystis pyrifera, or giant kelp forests. Kelp are a keystone species, and provide food, shelter and protection for all kinds of marine life, including commercially valuable fisheries. According to NOAA, factors influencing kelp forest growth include nutrients, light levels, temperatures, and ocean currents. Research by Smith et. al newly found that kelp use urea, in addition to ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen as nutrients for growth.\nIn this analysis, I would like to examine the relationship between ocean chemistry and kelp forest biomass, and develop a model for nutrient growth factors on biomass.\nThis exercise was produced as a part of the UCSB MEDS Program for EDS 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science, taught by Dr. Max Czapanskiy."

SBC LTER: Reef: Annual time series of biomass for kelp forest species, ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data are annual estimates of biomass of approximately 225 taxa of reef algae, invertebrates and fish in permanent transects at 11 kelp forest sites in the Santa Barbara Channel (2-8 transects per site). Abundance is measured annually (as percent cover or density, by size) and converted to biomass (i.e., wet mass, dry mass, decalcified dry mass, ash free dry mass) using published taxon-specific algorithms.

At a threshold of alpha = 0.05, we can reject our null hypothesis and state that PON has a positive effect on kelp wet mass.\nThe observed t-statistic is 2.73, which means that the estimated coefficient is 2.73 standard errors away from zero. In the figure, the null distribution shows us what we would expect if there was no relationship between PON and biomass (measured by density). The purple line falls outside of the majority of the distribution, which tells us that there is a strong relationship between PON and density."

    "text": "Due to incomplete data, I could not perform my intended analysis. The ocean chemistry and kelp data were inconsistently collected across sites and months, leaving very few usable data points after cleaning.\nThe model likely suffers from omitted variable bias. While prior research has established that temperature, currents, and light levels affect kelp growth, my model only included PON and site as variables, excluding other nutrients and physical variables.\nAutocorrelation may have affected the results because samples were taken at monthly intervals, and ecological conditions typically carry over from one month to the next. This violation of independence could lead to underestimated standard errors and overstated significance in the statistical results. However, techniques to reduce autocorrelation, such as a temporal lag model, were not feasible given the substantial missing data, which included gaps of several months in the joined dataset.\nOverall, the results of my models should not be considered reliable due to the significant data gaps. I had overestimated the completeness of the LTER data for this research question.\nFor future research, I would like to analyze Thomas Fire effects on kelp growth using a more complete ocean chemistry dataset. Researchers at UCSB discovered that wildfire ash from the 2017 Thomas Fire resulted in significant additions of dissolved nutrients, including inorganic and organic nitrogen, silicic acid, metals, and organic carbon. Furthermore, this ash leachate resulted in an increase of relative abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton. Since the impacts of wildfire products on Macrocystis pyrifera remain understudied, this could be a valuable area for investigation. Additional factors to consider would include kelp recruitment rates using a temporal lag model and dissolved metal concentrations."

    "text": "I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Environmental Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2021. Inspired by Santa Barbara’s legacy of environmental activism, I have dedicated myself to running local and federal campaigns with social justice and conservation-driven values for the past seven years. Following my undergraduate degree, I worked at an environmental law firm, specializing in litigation and regulatory disputes relating to remediation of Superfund sites. My professional experience includes roles in political organizing, legislation, and environmental law, where I honed skills in data management, community engagement, and environmental policy analysis.\nCurrently pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School, I aspire to work in government or to conduct policy relevant research after graduation. I aim to leverage data science techniques to develop solutions for resource management and climate change mitigation, promoting sustainable practices and enhancing climate resilience locally and globally.\nIn my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, gaming, and exploring nature and the night sky through my camera lens."
