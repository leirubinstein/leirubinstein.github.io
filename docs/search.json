    "text": "Santa Barbara’s coastal waters host some of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth, Macrocystis pyrifera, or giant kelp forests. Kelp are a keystone species, and provide food, shelter and protection for all kinds of marine life, including commercially valuable fisheries. According to NOAA, factors influencing kelp forest growth include nutrients, light levels, temperatures, and ocean currents. Research by Smith et. al newly found that kelp use urea, in addition to ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen as nutrients for growth.\nIn this analysis, I would like to examine the relationship between ocean chemistry and kelp forest biomass, and develop a model for nutrient growth factors on biomass.\nThis exercise was produced as a part of the UCSB MEDS Program for EDS 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science, taught by Dr. Max Czapanskiy.\n\n\n\n1. SBC LTER: Reef: Annual time series of biomass for kelp forest species, ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data are annual estimates of biomass of approximately 225 taxa of reef algae, invertebrates and fish in permanent transects at 11 kelp forest sites in the Santa Barbara Channel (2-8 transects per site). Abundance is measured annually (as percent cover or density, by size) and converted to biomass (i.e., wet mass, dry mass, decalcified dry mass, ash free dry mass) using published taxon-specific algorithms. Data collection began in summer 2000 and continues annually in summer to provide information on community structure, population dynamics and species change.\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER Reef Sites\n\n\n2. SBC LTER: Ocean: Ocean Currents and Biogeochemistry: Nearshore water profiles (monthly CTD and chemistry), ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data contain water chemistry measurements taken monthly at these reefs in the nearshore areas of the Santa Barbra Channel, CA, USA: Arroyo Quemado, Bullito, Naples, Arroyo Burro, Mohawk and Carpinteria. Measurements include standard CTD parameters, nutrients, pigments, particulate CN, total dissolved N and P, stable isotopes of C and N (not all parameters are measured at all stations). Sampling began in November 2000. Starting in February 2003, a SBE19-Plus with a rosette sampler was used. Some stations are sampled only occasionally.\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER Ocean Bottle Sites\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(readtext)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\nset.seed(42)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Read in kelp and ocean chemistry data\nspecies &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\n  \"posts/2024-12-12-ocean-chem-kelp/data/Annual_All_Species_Biomass_at_transect_20240823.csv\"), na = \"-99999\") %&gt;%\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\nocean_chem &lt;- read.table(here::here(\"posts/2024-12-12-ocean-chem-kelp/data/LTER_monthly_bottledata_20240821.txt\"), \n  header = TRUE, sep = \";\", na = c(\"BDL\", \"99999\")) %&gt;% # `BDL` = below detection level\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n# Filter to Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera)\nkelp &lt;- species %&gt;%\n  filter(scientific_name == \"Macrocystis pyrifera\")\n\n\nThe variables I plan to use for ocean chemistry are (in units of micromoles per liter):\n\nno2_no3_umol_l = concentration of the sum of nitrate and nitrite\npon_umol_l = concentration of particulate organic nitrogen\ntdn_umol_l= concentration of dissolved nitrogen\nammonia_umol_l= concentration of ammonium\nurea_umol_l= concentration of urea\n\nThe variables I plan to use for kelp biomass are:\n\nwm_gm2 = areal wet mass of individuals or colony in grams per square meter\ndensity = density taxon per squared meter in number per square meter\n\nNote: there are other measures of biomass in ocean_chem.

Biomass Model model_wm\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp biomass (p = 0.00749). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp wet mass increases by 147.54 grams/square meter when the reference site is BULL. Consistent with the “Monthly Average Giant Kelp Biomass by Site” plot, the MOHK site has significantly higher biomass than the other sites (coef = 3187.67, p = 1.46e-5). The model explains about 32.4% of the variation in biomass (not great).\n2. Log Biomass Model model_wm_log\nThere is a marginally significant positive relationship between PON and log-transformed kelp biomass (p = 0.080). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, log kelp wet mass increases by 0.068 units when the reference site is BULL. The ABUR site shows significantly lower biomass (coef = -1.389, p = 0.006) while MOHK shows significantly higher biomass (coef = 1.498, p = 0.003) compared to other sites. The model explains about 26.1% of the variation in log biomass (poor fit).\n3. Biomass Density Model model_wm_density\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp density (p = 0.002). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp density increases by 0.317 individuals per square meter when the reference site is BULL. Similar to the biomass models, the MOHK site shows significantly higher density than other sites (coef = 7.853, p &lt; 0.001). This model has the best fit of the three, explaining about 43.3% of the variation in density, but still is not great.\n\n\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH0: Particulate organic nitrogen has no effect on kelp biomass\nHA: Particulate organic nitrogen has an effect on kelp biomass\n\n\n\nCode\n# Get observed coefficient for pon_umol_l\nobserved_coef &lt;- coef(summary(model_wm))[\"pon_umol_l\", \"t value\"]\n\n# Create randomizations\nnull_dist &lt;- replicate(1000, {\n  rand_joined_data &lt;- joined_data %&gt;% \n    ungroup() %&gt;% \n    mutate(pon_umol_l = sample(pon_umol_l))\n  \n  rand_model &lt;- lm(wm_gm2 ~ pon_umol_l + site, data = rand_joined_data)\n  coef(summary(rand_model))[\"pon_umol_l\", \"t value\"]\n})\n\n# Calculate p-value (two-sided test)\np_value &lt;- mean(abs(null_dist) &gt;= abs(observed_coef))\n\n# Plot the null distribution\nnull_dist_df &lt;- data.frame(t_stat = null_dist)\nggplot(null_dist_df, aes(x = t_stat)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, \n                 fill = \"#6d8c23\", \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = observed_coef, color = \"orchid\", linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Null Distribution of PON Coefficient t-statistics\",\n       x = \"t-statistic\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Randomization test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nRandomization test p-value: 0.003 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Observed t-statistic:\", observed_coef, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved t-statistic: 2.734869 \n\n\nThis randomization test shuffled the data n = 1000 times to determine what the point estimate (t-statistic) would be if it occurred by chance. 0nly 0.3% of the time would a value of t = 2.37 be produced as chance. At a threshold of alpha = 0.05, we can reject our null hypothesis and state that PON has a positive effect on kelp wet mass.\nThe observed t-statistic is 2.73, which means that the estimated coefficient is 2.73 standard errors away from zero. In the figure, the null distribution shows us what we would expect if there was no relationship between PON and biomass (measured by density). The purple line falls outside of the majority of the distribution, which tells us that there is a strong relationship between PON and density.\n\n\n\nDue to incomplete data, I could not perform my intended analysis. The ocean chemistry and kelp data were inconsistently collected across sites and months, leaving very few usable data points after cleaning.\nThe model likely suffers from omitted variable bias. While prior research has established that temperature, currents, and light levels affect kelp growth, my model only included PON and site as variables, excluding other nutrients and physical variables.\nAutocorrelation may have affected the results because samples were taken at monthly intervals, and ecological conditions typically carry over from one month to the next. This violation of independence could lead to underestimated standard errors and overstated significance in the statistical results. However, techniques to reduce autocorrelation, such as a temporal lag model, were not feasible given the substantial missing data, which included gaps of several months in the joined dataset.\nOverall, the results of my models should not be considered reliable due to the significant data gaps. I had overestimated the completeness of the LTER data for this research question.\nFor future research, I would like to analyze Thomas Fire effects on kelp growth using a more complete ocean chemistry dataset. Researchers at UCSB discovered that wildfire ash from the 2017 Thomas Fire resulted in significant additions of dissolved nutrients, including inorganic and organic nitrogen, silicic acid, metals, and organic carbon. Furthermore, this ash leachate resulted in an increase of relative abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton. Since the impacts of wildfire products on Macrocystis pyrifera remain understudied, this could be a valuable area for investigation. Additional factors to consider would include kelp recruitment rates using a temporal lag model and dissolved metal concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nCitation\nLink\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER: Ocean: Ocean Currents and Biogeochemistry: Nearshore water profiles (monthly CTD and chemistry), ongoing since 2000\nWashburn, L., M.

    "text": "1. SBC LTER: Reef: Annual time series of biomass for kelp forest species, ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data are annual estimates of biomass of approximately 225 taxa of reef algae, invertebrates and fish in permanent transects at 11 kelp forest sites in the Santa Barbara Channel (2-8 transects per site). Abundance is measured annually (as percent cover or density, by size) and converted to biomass (i.e., wet mass, dry mass, decalcified dry mass, ash free dry mass) using published taxon-specific algorithms. Data collection began in summer 2000 and continues annually in summer to provide information on community structure, population dynamics and species change.\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER Reef Sites\n\n\n2. SBC LTER: Ocean: Ocean Currents and Biogeochemistry: Nearshore water profiles (monthly CTD and chemistry), ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data contain water chemistry measurements taken monthly at these reefs in the nearshore areas of the Santa Barbra Channel, CA, USA: Arroyo Quemado, Bullito, Naples, Arroyo Burro, Mohawk and Carpinteria. Measurements include standard CTD parameters, nutrients, pigments, particulate CN, total dissolved N and P, stable isotopes of C and N (not all parameters are measured at all stations). Sampling began in November 2000. Starting in February 2003, a SBE19-Plus with a rosette sampler was used.

Biomass Model model_wm\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp biomass (p = 0.00749). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp wet mass increases by 147.54 grams/square meter when the reference site is BULL. Consistent with the “Monthly Average Giant Kelp Biomass by Site” plot, the MOHK site has significantly higher biomass than the other sites (coef = 3187.67, p = 1.46e-5). The model explains about 32.4% of the variation in biomass (not great).\n2. Log Biomass Model model_wm_log\nThere is a marginally significant positive relationship between PON and log-transformed kelp biomass (p = 0.080). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, log kelp wet mass increases by 0.068 units when the reference site is BULL. The ABUR site shows significantly lower biomass (coef = -1.389, p = 0.006) while MOHK shows significantly higher biomass (coef = 1.498, p = 0.003) compared to other sites. The model explains about 26.1% of the variation in log biomass (poor fit).\n3. Biomass Density Model model_wm_density\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp density (p = 0.002). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp density increases by 0.317 individuals per square meter when the reference site is BULL. Similar to the biomass models, the MOHK site shows significantly higher density than other sites (coef = 7.853, p &lt; 0.001). This model has the best fit of the three, explaining about 43.3% of the variation in density, but still is not great."

    "text": "Due to incomplete data, I could not perform my intended analysis. The ocean chemistry and kelp data were inconsistently collected across sites and months, leaving very few usable data points after cleaning.\nThe model likely suffers from omitted variable bias. While prior research has established that temperature, currents, and light levels affect kelp growth, my model only included PON and site as variables, excluding other nutrients and physical variables.\nAutocorrelation may have affected the results because samples were taken at monthly intervals, and ecological conditions typically carry over from one month to the next. This violation of independence could lead to underestimated standard errors and overstated significance in the statistical results. However, techniques to reduce autocorrelation, such as a temporal lag model, were not feasible given the substantial missing data, which included gaps of several months in the joined dataset.\nOverall, the results of my models should not be considered reliable due to the significant data gaps. I had overestimated the completeness of the LTER data for this research question.\nFor future research, I would like to analyze Thomas Fire effects on kelp growth using a more complete ocean chemistry dataset. Researchers at UCSB discovered that wildfire ash from the 2017 Thomas Fire resulted in significant additions of dissolved nutrients, including inorganic and organic nitrogen, silicic acid, metals, and organic carbon. Furthermore, this ash leachate resulted in an increase of relative abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton. Since the impacts of wildfire products on Macrocystis pyrifera remain understudied, this could be a valuable area for investigation. Additional factors to consider would include kelp recruitment rates using a temporal lag model and dissolved metal concentrations."

    "text": "About\nPurpose: This analysis explores the 2017 Thomas Fire using two main approaches:\n\nCreating visualizations of the fire perimeter and burn area using Landsat satellite imagery\nAnalyzing the types and distribution of land cover affected by the fire\n\nUsing historical fire perimeter data from CalFire combined with Landsat imagery, we create detailed maps showing both true-color and false-color visualizations of the Thomas Fire area. Here we use historical fire perimeter data from CalFire to obtain the perimeter of the 2017 Thomas Fire. Using provided Landsat imagery and the fire perimeter, we create a map showing the perimeter of the 2017 Thomas Fire in relation to Santa Barbara County.\nWe then analyze land cover data to understand what types of ecosystems were impacted by the fire. Using the GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems data for 2011 from the US Geological Survey (USGS), we calculate the area of each land cover type within the fire perimeter and compare it to the total area of each land cover type in Santa Barbara County.\nHighlights:\n\nCleaning data\nLabel-based selection\nGeospatial file creation\nrioxarray raster file manipulation\nTrue color imagery plotting\nFalse color imagery plotting\nPixel-based land cover calculations\nArea and percentage computations\n\nDataset Descriptions:\nSection 1:\nThe landsat data is a simplified collection of bands from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. This data was retrieved from the Microsoft Planetary Computer data catalogue and pre-processed to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution.\nCalifornia’s Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) maintains a comprehensive database of historical fire perimeters throughout the state, covering both public and private lands. This GIS dataset is updated annually through a collaborative effort between FRAP and several federal agencies - the U.S. Forest Service Region 5, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service.\nSection 2:\nThe GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems data for 2011 @davidson_gaplandfire_2016, from the US Geological Survey (USGS) is a categorical raster with a 30 m x 30 m pixel resolution representing highly thematically detailed land cover map of the U.S.\nThe class names and corresponding codes have been saved to a separate CSV to simplify access.

    "text": "Conclusion\nHere we see the Thomas Fire predominantly affected coastal and chaparral ecosystems, with over 56% of the burned area consisting of coastal scrub and mixed chaparral vegetation types. Oak woodlands and savannas made up another significant portion, accounting for about 18% of the affected area. Only a small percentage of the burned area was developed land, indicating that the fire primarily affected natural ecosystems. Understanding the distribution of land cover types affected by the fire can help inform future land management decisions and restoration efforts in the area, and plan future fire management strategies. These findings highlight the importance of managing and protecting California’s coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems, which are naturally adapted to fire but face increasing pressure from climate change and altered fire regimes."
