Inspired by Santa Barbara’s legacy of environmental activism, I have dedicated myself to running local and federal campaigns with social justice and conservation-driven values for the past seven years. Following my undergraduate degree, I worked at an environmental law firm, specializing in litigation and regulatory disputes relating to remediation of Superfund sites. My professional experience includes roles in political organizing, legislation, and environmental law, where I honed skills in public communication, community engagement, and environmental policy analysis.\nCurrently pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School, I aspire to work in environmental economics research or government. I aim to leverage remote sensing and machine learning techniques to develop solutions for resource management and climate change mitigation, promoting sustainable practices and enhancing climate resilience locally and globally.\nIn my free time, I enjoy biking, gaming, and exploring nature and the night sky through my camera lens."

    "text": "Why voter data?\nSince childhood, I’ve been interested in politics– a fault I attribute to my dad. We were your typical liberal Prius-driving NPR listeners and CNN-blaring-in-the-background household. Upon moving to Santa Barbara in 2017 for my undergraduate degree, I’ve volunteered or worked in every election, traveling up and down the county to knock on doors for local candidates with pro-environment and pro-housing values.\n\n\n\nSome campaigns over the years\n\n\nMost visualizations of voter data happen at the national or state level, rather than within counties. Furthermore, election data from the 2024 general election has not been fully certified yet for most counties in California. I aim to provide a quick overview of the political composition of our county using voter registration and census data for people interested in local politics. A few questions I’d like to answer include:\n\nHow are Democratic and Republican voters spatially distributed throughout the county?\nWhat is the political composition of the county?\nIs there a partisan difference between voter ages?\nHow do voter registrations change over time? Do they increase in frequency closer to elections?"

It contains voter registration information (voter name, address, contact information, voting precinct, and political party affiliation) for all voters in the county.\nFor census data, I use the tidycensus and tigris packages, with 2020 and 2023 geometries and population surveys, and tidygeocoder for addresses."

    "section": "Visualizations",
    "text": "Visualizations\n\nHow are voters distributed across the county? I wanted to plot the difference in percentage of Democrats compared to Republicans across the county. I chose a chloropleth map to visualize this, because it is a good way to display spatial relationships. In Santa Barbara, urban centers in South County tend to lean heavily Democratic, while more rural areas are Republican. One challenge with displaying partisanship on a chloropleth map, however, is the visual overrepresentation of sparsely populated but large geographic areas. It appears as though a large portion of the county is red, when in reality very few people live in those areas, and the county as a whole leans solidly Democratic. Census blocks tend to be smaller than tracts, and areas with no population were excluded, therefore lessening the visual effect of area.\nWhat is the partisan breakdown of the county I’ve included a waffle plot displaying the proportion of voters by party to visualize the percentage of voters belonging to each political party.\nHow old are Democrats vs. Republicans? For this visualization, I chose stacked bar charts to visualize the age breakdowns within each party and across the county. On average, Democrats are slightly younger than Republicans.\nWhen do people register to vote? Voters generally register to vote closer to elections, and we can see that there is a noticeable spike in the line graph of number of registrations each general election year (labeled on the x-axis). When we look at the weekly and daily registration trends leading up to the 2024 general election, we see a spike in registrations around the registration deadline and on election day."

This could be because the census designates some universities as “group quarters” and counts them differently compared to other residences.

address.\n\n\nVisualization 2: Party Proportions\n\n\nShow code\n# --------------- Visualization 2: Party Proportions Waffle Chart --------------\n# Create waffle chart of party

I wanted my quick-glance infographic to present the data in a formal, news-oriented format, as if it were something you would see on the New York Times or 538.\n\n\nMy aesthetic choices and theming were heavily influenced by New York Times and other legacy news media data visualizations. I chose red and blue since they’re the traditional colors that represent political parties, in addition to purple and grey as neutral colors. The text for my individual plots provides an overview for each plot as a standalone, explaining relationships and key takeaways.\n\n\nI aim to provide sub-county level visualizations of partisanship for SB County. While the south portion of the county is heavily Democratic, rural areas and north county leans more Republican. Registered Republicans are slightly older than Democrats, but also wait until the last minute to register to vote.\nThese visualizations provide a quick way to glean context from local outcomes of elections. They can be used as tool to compare vote shares for candiates or issues against, or to look at partisan counts for redistricting efforts.\n\n\nWhile my spatial visualization is not colorblind friendly, I have included alt-text to improve accessibility for those using screen readers. In the future, I would like to create a colorblind-friendly version of this infographic.\n\n\nBecause my voter data only includes age variables, I chose to focus on partisan differences between Democrats and Republicans in this analysis rather than incorporating other demographic variables. However, adding census-tract level analysis using additional variables like income, race/ethnicity, or housing burden from the American Community Survey could be interesting.\nFurthermore, a partisan analysis lends itself to the concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The modern Republican party under Trump has attempted to kill DEI initiatives and mentions of it from government. It’s worth visualizing voter sentiments locally, because while Trump won the 2024 election, SB county remains deeply blue, especially south county."

    "text": "Santa Barbara’s coastal waters host some of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth, Macrocystis pyrifera, or giant kelp forests. Kelp are a keystone species, and provide food, shelter and protection for all kinds of marine life, including commercially valuable fisheries. According to NOAA, factors influencing kelp forest growth include nutrients, light levels, temperatures, and ocean currents. Research by Smith et. al newly found that kelp use urea, in addition to ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen as nutrients for growth.\nIn this analysis, I would like to examine the relationship between ocean chemistry and kelp forest biomass, and develop a model for nutrient growth factors on biomass.\nThis exercise was produced as a part of the UCSB MEDS Program for EDS 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science, taught by Dr. Max Czapanskiy.\n\n\n\n1. SBC LTER: Reef: Annual time series of biomass for kelp forest species, ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data are annual estimates of biomass of approximately 225 taxa of reef algae, invertebrates and fish in permanent transects at 11 kelp forest sites in the Santa Barbara Channel (2-8 transects per site). Abundance is measured annually (as percent cover or density, by size) and converted to biomass (i.e., wet mass, dry mass, decalcified dry mass, ash free dry mass) using published taxon-specific algorithms. Data collection began in summer 2000 and continues annually in summer to provide information on community structure, population dynamics and species change.\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER Reef Sites\n\n\n2. SBC LTER: Ocean: Ocean Currents and Biogeochemistry: Nearshore water profiles (monthly CTD and chemistry), ongoing since 2000\n\nThese data contain water chemistry measurements taken monthly at these reefs in the nearshore areas of the Santa Barbra Channel, CA, USA: Arroyo Quemado, Bullito, Naples, Arroyo Burro, Mohawk and Carpinteria. Measurements include standard CTD parameters, nutrients, pigments, particulate CN, total dissolved N and P, stable isotopes of C and N (not all parameters are measured at all stations).

Biomass Model model_wm\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp biomass (p = 0.00749). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp wet mass increases by 147.54 grams/square meter when the reference site is BULL. Consistent with the “Monthly Average Giant Kelp Biomass by Site” plot, the MOHK site has significantly higher biomass than the other sites (coef = 3187.67, p = 1.46e-5). The model explains about 32.4% of the variation in biomass (not great).\n2. Log Biomass Model model_wm_log\nThere is a marginally significant positive relationship between PON and log-transformed kelp biomass (p = 0.080). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, log kelp wet mass increases by 0.068 units when the reference site is BULL. The ABUR site shows significantly lower biomass (coef = -1.389, p = 0.006) while MOHK shows significantly higher biomass (coef = 1.498, p = 0.003) compared to other sites. The model explains about 26.1% of the variation in log biomass (poor fit).\n3. Biomass Density Model model_wm_density\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp density (p = 0.002). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp density increases by 0.317 individuals per square meter when the reference site is BULL. Similar to the biomass models, the MOHK site shows significantly higher density than other sites (coef = 7.853, p &lt; 0.001). This model has the best fit of the three, explaining about 43.3% of the variation in density, but still is not great.\n\n\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH0: Particulate organic nitrogen has no effect on kelp biomass\nHA: Particulate organic nitrogen has an effect on kelp biomass\n\n\n\nCode\n# Get observed coefficient for pon_umol_l\nobserved_coef &lt;- coef(summary(model_wm))[\"pon_umol_l\", \"t value\"]\n\n# Create randomizations\nnull_dist &lt;- replicate(1000, {\n  rand_joined_data &lt;- joined_data %&gt;% \n    ungroup() %&gt;% \n    mutate(pon_umol_l = sample(pon_umol_l))\n  \n  rand_model &lt;- lm(wm_gm2 ~ pon_umol_l + site, data = rand_joined_data)\n  coef(summary(rand_model))[\"pon_umol_l\", \"t value\"]\n})\n\n# Calculate p-value (two-sided test)\np_value &lt;- mean(abs(null_dist) &gt;= abs(observed_coef))\n\n# Plot the null distribution\nnull_dist_df &lt;- data.frame(t_stat = null_dist)\nggplot(null_dist_df, aes(x = t_stat)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, \n                 fill = \"#6d8c23\", \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = observed_coef, color = \"orchid\", linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Null Distribution of PON Coefficient t-statistics\",\n       x = \"t-statistic\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Randomization test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nRandomization test p-value: 0.003 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Observed t-statistic:\", observed_coef, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved t-statistic: 2.734869 \n\n\nThis randomization test shuffled the data n = 1000 times to determine what the point estimate (t-statistic) would be if it occurred by chance. 0nly 0.3% of the time would a value of t = 2.37 be produced as chance. At a threshold of alpha = 0.05, we can reject our null hypothesis and state that PON has a positive effect on kelp wet mass.\nThe observed t-statistic is 2.73, which means that the estimated coefficient is 2.73 standard errors away from zero. In the figure, the null distribution shows us what we would expect if there was no relationship between PON and biomass (measured by density). The purple line falls outside of the majority of the distribution, which tells us that there is a strong relationship between PON and density.\n\n\n\nDue to incomplete data, I could not perform my intended analysis. The ocean chemistry and kelp data were inconsistently collected across sites and months, leaving very few usable data points after cleaning.\nThe model likely suffers from omitted variable bias. While prior research has established that temperature, currents, and light levels affect kelp growth, my model only included PON and site as variables, excluding other nutrients and physical variables.\nAutocorrelation may have affected the results because samples were taken at monthly intervals, and ecological conditions typically carry over from one month to the next. This violation of independence could lead to underestimated standard errors and overstated significance in the statistical results. However, techniques to reduce autocorrelation, such as a temporal lag model, were not feasible given the substantial missing data, which included gaps of several months in the joined dataset.\nOverall, the results of my models should not be considered reliable due to the significant data gaps. I had overestimated the completeness of the LTER data for this research question.\nFor future research, I would like to analyze Thomas Fire effects on kelp growth using a more complete ocean chemistry dataset. Researchers at UCSB discovered that wildfire ash from the 2017 Thomas Fire resulted in significant additions of dissolved nutrients, including inorganic and organic nitrogen, silicic acid, metals, and organic carbon. Furthermore, this ash leachate resulted in an increase of relative abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton. Since the impacts of wildfire products on Macrocystis pyrifera remain understudied, this could be a valuable area for investigation. Additional factors to consider would include kelp recruitment rates using a temporal lag model and dissolved metal concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nCitation\nLink\n\n\n\n\nSBC LTER: Ocean: Ocean Currents and Biogeochemistry: Nearshore water profiles (monthly CTD and chemistry), ongoing since 2000\nWashburn, L., M.

    "text": "Santa Barbara’s coastal waters host some of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth, Macrocystis pyrifera, or giant kelp forests. Kelp are a keystone species, and provide food, shelter and protection for all kinds of marine life, including commercially valuable fisheries. According to NOAA, factors influencing kelp forest growth include nutrients, light levels, temperatures, and ocean currents. Research by Smith et. al newly found that kelp use urea, in addition to ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen as nutrients for growth.\nIn this analysis, I would like to examine the relationship between ocean chemistry and kelp forest biomass, and develop a model for nutrient growth factors on biomass.\nThis exercise was produced as a part of the UCSB MEDS Program for EDS 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science, taught by Dr. Max Czapanskiy."

Biomass Model model_wm\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp biomass (p = 0.00749). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp wet mass increases by 147.54 grams/square meter when the reference site is BULL. Consistent with the “Monthly Average Giant Kelp Biomass by Site” plot, the MOHK site has significantly higher biomass than the other sites (coef = 3187.67, p = 1.46e-5). The model explains about 32.4% of the variation in biomass (not great).\n2. Log Biomass Model model_wm_log\nThere is a marginally significant positive relationship between PON and log-transformed kelp biomass (p = 0.080). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, log kelp wet mass increases by 0.068 units when the reference site is BULL. The ABUR site shows significantly lower biomass (coef = -1.389, p = 0.006) while MOHK shows significantly higher biomass (coef = 1.498, p = 0.003) compared to other sites. The model explains about 26.1% of the variation in log biomass (poor fit).\n3. Biomass Density Model model_wm_density\nThere is a significant positive relationship between PON and kelp density (p = 0.002). For every one μmol/L increase in PON concentration, kelp density increases by 0.317 individuals per square meter when the reference site is BULL. Similar to the biomass models, the MOHK site shows significantly higher density than other sites (coef = 7.853, p &lt; 0.001). This model has the best fit of the three, explaining about 43.3% of the variation in density, but still is not great."

At a threshold of alpha = 0.05, we can reject our null hypothesis and state that PON has a positive effect on kelp wet mass.\nThe observed t-statistic is 2.73, which means that the estimated coefficient is 2.73 standard errors away from zero. In the figure, the null distribution shows us what we would expect if there was no relationship between PON and biomass (measured by density). The purple line falls outside of the majority of the distribution, which tells us that there is a strong relationship between PON and density."

    "text": "Due to incomplete data, I could not perform my intended analysis. The ocean chemistry and kelp data were inconsistently collected across sites and months, leaving very few usable data points after cleaning.\nThe model likely suffers from omitted variable bias. While prior research has established that temperature, currents, and light levels affect kelp growth, my model only included PON and site as variables, excluding other nutrients and physical variables.\nAutocorrelation may have affected the results because samples were taken at monthly intervals, and ecological conditions typically carry over from one month to the next. This violation of independence could lead to underestimated standard errors and overstated significance in the statistical results. However, techniques to reduce autocorrelation, such as a temporal lag model, were not feasible given the substantial missing data, which included gaps of several months in the joined dataset.\nOverall, the results of my models should not be considered reliable due to the significant data gaps. I had overestimated the completeness of the LTER data for this research question.\nFor future research, I would like to analyze Thomas Fire effects on kelp growth using a more complete ocean chemistry dataset. Researchers at UCSB discovered that wildfire ash from the 2017 Thomas Fire resulted in significant additions of dissolved nutrients, including inorganic and organic nitrogen, silicic acid, metals, and organic carbon. Furthermore, this ash leachate resulted in an increase of relative abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton. Since the impacts of wildfire products on Macrocystis pyrifera remain understudied, this could be a valuable area for investigation. Additional factors to consider would include kelp recruitment rates using a temporal lag model and dissolved metal concentrations."

    "text": "About\nPurpose: This analysis explores the 2017 Thomas Fire using two main approaches:\n\nCreating visualizations of the fire perimeter and burn area using Landsat satellite imagery\nAnalyzing the types and distribution of land cover affected by the fire\n\nUsing historical fire perimeter data from CalFire combined with Landsat imagery, we create detailed maps showing both true-color and false-color visualizations of the Thomas Fire area. Here we use historical fire perimeter data from CalFire to obtain the perimeter of the 2017 Thomas Fire. Using provided Landsat imagery and the fire perimeter, we create a map showing the perimeter of the 2017 Thomas Fire in relation to Santa Barbara County.\nWe then analyze land cover data to understand what types of ecosystems were impacted by the fire. Using the GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems data for 2011 from the US Geological Survey (USGS), we calculate the area of each land cover type within the fire perimeter and compare it to the total area of each land cover type in Santa Barbara County.\nHighlights:\n\nCleaning data\nLabel-based selection\nGeospatial file creation\nrioxarray raster file manipulation\nTrue color imagery plotting\nFalse color imagery plotting\nPixel-based land cover calculations\nArea and percentage computations\n\nDataset Descriptions:\nSection 1:\nThe landsat data is a simplified collection of bands from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. This data was retrieved from the Microsoft Planetary Computer data catalogue and pre-processed to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution.\nCalifornia’s Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) maintains a comprehensive database of historical fire perimeters throughout the state, covering both public and private lands. This GIS dataset is updated annually through a collaborative effort between FRAP and several federal agencies - the U.S. Forest Service Region 5, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service.\nSection 2:\nThe GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems data for 2011 @davidson_gaplandfire_2016, from the US Geological Survey (USGS) is a categorical raster with a 30 m x 30 m pixel resolution representing highly thematically detailed land cover map of the U.S.\nThe class names and corresponding codes have been saved to a separate CSV to simplify access. Further information on how to access the classes directly from the data are available in the MPC catalog.\nPlease see end for references\n\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport rioxarray as rioxr\nfrom shapely import box\nfrom IPython.display import Image"

    "text": "Conclusion\nHere we see the Thomas Fire predominantly affected coastal and chaparral ecosystems, with over 56% of the burned area consisting of coastal scrub and mixed chaparral vegetation types. Oak woodlands and savannas made up another significant portion, accounting for about 18% of the affected area. Only a small percentage of the burned area was developed land, indicating that the fire primarily affected natural ecosystems. Understanding the distribution of land cover types affected by the fire can help inform future land management decisions and restoration efforts in the area, and plan future fire management strategies. These findings highlight the importance of managing and protecting California’s coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems, which are naturally adapted to fire but face increasing pressure from climate change and altered fire regimes."
