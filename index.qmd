I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Environmental Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2021. Inspired by Santa Barbaraâ€™s legacy of environmental activism, I have dedicated myself to running local and federal campaigns with social justice and conservation-driven values for the past seven years. Following my undergraduate degree, I worked at an environmental law firm, specializing in litigation and regulatory disputes relating to remediation of Superfund sites. My professional experience includes roles in political organizing, legislation, and environmental law, where I honed skills in public communication, community engagement, and environmental policy analysis.

Currently pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School, I aspire to work in environmental economics research or government. I aim to leverage remote sensing and machine learning techniques to develop solutions for resource management and climate change mitigation, promoting sustainable practices and enhancing climate resilience locally and globally.

In my free time, I enjoy biking, gaming, and exploring nature and the night sky through my camera lens. Check out some of my photography [here](https://leirubinstein.github.io/nature-photography.html).
