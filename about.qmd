## Welcome

Hi there! My name is Leilanie Rubinstein, and I'm recent graduate of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in Santa Barbara, California. This is my personal website and data science blog (along with a few photos I've taken).

## Background

I'm from [Palm Springs, CA](https://visitpalmsprings.com/), a desert town in the Coachella Valley of Southern California.

Growing up in a place where the summers are so hot that the asphalt begins to melt primed me to care about the impacts of climate change from an early age. Extreme heat and drought, among other consequences, affect socioeconomically disadvantaged populations the most.

My motivation for pursuing a career in environmental data science stems from wanting to understand how we can better serve our communities and ecosystems impacted by climate change. I strongly believe that data-driven solutions promote better public policy.
